<SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR OLD PEOPLE>
1. Provide Clear Color To Support Mental Calmness For Old People
According to COLOR ASSIGNMENT Vision screening test's result, most of old people will feel comfortable and have a relax affect when they see BLUE. Other than blue color, they love to see Red and Black.(Referece: http://www.joehallock.com/edu/COM498/preferences.html) Therefore, in this game I designed blue color for every button, paddles, and bricks, and red color to display title or any other words in the game. To provide unified vision of color to old people, they will be definately enjoy this game very well.
2. Create Simple Rule And Play Style With Many Opportunities And Selection To Enjoy the Game
Easy to remember how to play by designing just few keyboards' event handlers and mouse movement without deploying many key affects.But Other than just play, I designed several selections to give all old people to play the games. They are Quick Game, Level Up game, and Level List Game. Quick Game is for old people who just want to play once or try if this game is fit for corresponding player. Level Up Game is for old people who want to play continuously and challenge him/herself to enjoy the game. If each level of game complete, this game will automatically up to next level's. Level List game is for old people who are not willing to start from beginning of the level up game, and choose the level of what he/she wants to try.Therefore, Many opportunities to play different kind of patterns and background of game and let old people to have fun!
